[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kolawolebalogun/flask_upload_image.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kolawolebalogun/flask_upload_image)

A very simple Flask app which accepts a photo upload via a form, and then displays that photo back to the user, without saving the uploaded file, simply sends it back as a response.

## Requirement

Flask Upload Image has been tested in the following environments

* Python (3.6)

## Installation

First you create a virtual environment with `virtualenv venv` or `virtualenv -p python3.6 venv` and enter it with `source venv/bin/activate` in order to keep everything contained. 

Then you run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
